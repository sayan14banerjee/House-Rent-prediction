# House Rent Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the rent prices of houses based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of information about different houses such as their size, location, number of rooms, etc.

## Overview

Predicting house rent prices is an essential task in the real estate industry. It helps landlords, tenants, and real estate agents to estimate fair prices for renting or leasing properties. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house rent prices based on relevant features.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found in the `data` directory. It contains information about various houses, including features such as size, location, number of rooms, amenities, etc. The dataset is provided in CSV format (`house_rent_data.csv`).

## Model

The rent prediction model is implemented using Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. The model is trained on the dataset to predict the rent prices of houses based on their features. Various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc., are explored to find the best-performing model.

## Usage

To run the model:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sayan14banerjee/House-Rent-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd House-Rent-prediction
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `rent_prediction.ipynb` to see the model implementation and evaluation.
